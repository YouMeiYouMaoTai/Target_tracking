""" This module exposes the image processing methods as module level global
variables, that are loaded based on user defined flags.

Since there are multiple different implementations and libraries available for each
of the image tasks we want perform (e.g 'load jpeg' and 'resize'), we give the
user the choice of using different versions of each function without changing
the rest of the code. One example in which one would use a 'safe' flag is if
there are non jpeg images in the dataset, as imageio.imread can read them,
but not jpeg4py.

The basic changes introduced here are the libjpeg-turbo which is a instruction
level parallel (SSE, AVX, etc) implementation of the default C++ jpeg lib
libjpeg. Morover we also switched the default Pillow for a fork called PIL-SIMD,
which is identical in terms of the API but uses vectorized instructions as well
as heavy loop unrolling to optimize some of Pillows functions (particularly the
resize function). Since the PIL-SIMD is a drop-in replacement for Pillow, even
if the SIMD version is not installed the program should work just as fine with
the default Pillow (without the massive speed gains, though).

    box has an even number of pixels in either dimension we approach the center
    of the bounding box as the floor in each dimension, which may displace the
    actual center half a pixel in each dimension. This way we always deal with
    bounding boxes of odd size in each dimension. Furthermore, we add the same
    amount of context region in every direction, which makes the effective
    region size always an odd integer as well, so to enforce this approach we

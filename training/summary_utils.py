        tensors of with dimensions [C x H x W] or [B x C x H x W] if the tensor
        has a batch dimension it takes the FIRST ELEMENT of the batch. The image
        is displayed as fusion of the input image in grayscale and the overlay
        in the chosen color_map, this fusion is controlled by the alpha factor.
        In the case of the embeddings, since there are multiple feature
        channels, we show each of them individually in a grid.
        OBS: The colors represent relative values, where the peak color corresponds
        to the maximum value in any given channel, so no direct value comparisons
        can be made between epochs, only the relative distribution of neighboring
        pixel values, (which should be enough, since we are mosly interested
        in finding the maximum of a given correlation map)

        Args:
            tag: (str) The string identifying the image in tensorboard, images
                with the same tag are grouped together with a slider, and are
                indexed by epoch.
            embed: (torch.Tensor) The tensor containing the embedding of an
                input (ref or search image) or a correlation map (the final
                output). The shape should be [B, C, H, W] or [B, H, W] for the
                case of the correlation map.
            img: (torch.Tensor) The image on top of which the embed is going
                to be overlaid. Reference image embeddings should be overlaid
                on top of reference images and search image embeddings as well
                as the correlation maps should be overlaid on top of the search
                images.
            alpha: (float) A mixing variable, it controls how much of the final
                embedding corresponds to the grayscale input image and how much
                corresponds to the overlay. Alpha = 0, means there is no
                overlay in the final image, only the input image. Conversely,
                Alpha = 1 means there is only overlay. Adjust this value so
                you can distinctly see the overlay details while still seeing
                where it is in relation to the orignal image.
            cmap: (str) The name of the colormap to be used with the overlay.
                The colormaps are defined in the colormaps.py module, but values
                include 'viridis' (greenish blue) and 'inferno' (yellowish red).
            add_ref: (torch.Tensor) Optional. An additional reference image that
                will be plotted to the side of the other images. Useful when
                plotting correlation maps, because it lets the user see both
                the search image and the reference that is used as the target.
